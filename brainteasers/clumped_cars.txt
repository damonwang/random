============
Clumped Cars
============

My friend A.S. gave me this solution over some beer last night, and R.T.
and I worked on it for a while.  The next day, I tried again with M.L.
and we think this is correct.  Suggestions and corrections are welcome.


Problem Statement
=================

There are n cars placed bumper-to-bumper facing the same way ("forward")
on an infinitely long single-lane road.  Each driver is told to drive at
a randomly selected, unique speed from the first n natural numbers, and
forbidden to overtake.  After an infinitely long while, the cars will
have formed some number of clumps along the road.  How many clumps
should we expect?

In case the assignment of speeds is unclear, imagine assigning the ith
driver the speed i mph and then shuffling drivers before letting anyone
start.  Every speed is assigned exactly once.


Example
=======

For n = 3, we can answer the question by tabulating all 3! = 6 possible
assignments of speeds and the number of clumps each assignment produces:

Assignment  Clumps      Number of Clumps
(1, 2, 3)	(1 2 3)     3
(1, 3, 2)	(1 3-2)     2
(2, 1, 3)	(2-1 3)	    2
(2, 3, 1)	(2-3-1)	    1
(3, 1, 2)	(3-1 2)	    2
(3, 2, 1)   (3-2-1)     1

So the expectation value is 11/6 for n = 3.


Solution
========

Our strategy was to find a recursive formula and then solve the
recurrence relation.

In the base case where n = 0, it is clear that zero cars form zero
clumps: 
    C(0) = 0

For n > 0, every car behind the slowest (1 mph) car will clump up behind
it.  So if the slowest car has position i in line, then we have C(n-i)
clumps due to the cars in front of it, and 1 clump from everybody else
piling up behind the slowest car.  Averaging over all possible positions
of the slowest car, 
    C(n) = (1 / n) * Sum_{i = 1}^{n} [ C(n - i) + 1 ]
or, with some rearrangement, 
    n C(n) - n = Sum_{i = 1}^{n} C(n - i) 
and rewriting the indices to give Eq. (1):
    n C(n) - n = Sum_{i = 0}^{n-1} C(i)

For n - 1 cars, we have
    (n - 1) C(n - 1) - n + 1 = Sum_{i = 0}^{n - 2} C(i)
Adding C(n - 1) to both sides gives Eq. (2):
    n C(n - 1) - n + 1 = Sum_{i = 0}^{n - 1} C(i)
    
Noting that (1) and (2) have identical right-hand sides, 
    n C(n) - n = n C(n - 1) - n + 1     =>
    n C(n) = n C(n - 1) + 1             =>
    C(n) = C(n - 1) + 1/n

So C(0) = 0 and C(n > 0) = H_n where H_n is the nth partial sum of the
harmonic series 1, 1/2, 1/3, ..., 1/n, ...
